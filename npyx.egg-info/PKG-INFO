        ***************************************************************************************************
        Formal Definition of a "routine" -> a python function with the following properties:
        - short memorable name
        - computes a commonly used Variable from a raw dataset directory.
        - when called, looks for the Variable in dir/routinesMemory where dir is the directory of 
          the dataset. If not found, the routine saves the variable after having computed it.
        ***************************************************************************************************
        
        Python version has to be >=3.7 ot there will be imports issues!

        ## Installation:
        Using a conda environment is very much advised. Instructions here: [manage conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
        - from a local repository (recommended if plans to work on it/regularly pull upgrades)
        
        ```
        $ conda activate env_name
        $ cd path/to/save_dir # any directory where your code will be accessible by your editor and safe. NOT downloads folder.
        $ git clone https://github.com/Npix-routines/NeuroPyxels
        $ cd NeuroPyxels
        $ python setup.py develop # this will create an egg link to save_dir, which means that you do not need to reinstall the package each time you pull an udpate from github.
        
        ```
        - from the remote repository (recommended for easy passive install)
        ```
        $ conda activate env_name
        $ pip install git+https://github.com/Npix-routines/NeuroPyxels@master
        
        ```
        - Now test that the installation works.
        If it doesn't, figure out which packages are missing from the error log.
        ```
        $ conda activate env_name
        $ python
        >>> import npix # NO ERROR OMG THIS PACKAGE IS SO AWESOME
        
        ```
        
        ### Pull remote updates (after Maxime's updates :)):
        ```
        $ conda activate env_name
        $ cd path/to/save_dir/NeuroPyxels
        $ git pull
        # And that's it, thanks to the egg link no need to reinstall the package!
        ```
        
        ### Push local updates:
        ```
        # DO NOT DO THAT WITHOUT CHECKING WITH MAXIME FIRST
        # ONLY ON DEDICATED BRANCH CREATED WITH THE GITHUB BROWSER INTERFACE
        
        $ cd path/to/save_dir/NeuroPyxels
        $ git checkout DEDICATED_BRANCH_NAME # ++++++ IMPORTANT
        $ git add.
        $ git commit -m "commit details - try to be specific"
        $ git push origin DEDICATED_BRANCH_NAME # ++++++ IMPORTANT
        
        # Then pull request to master branch using the online github green button! Do not forget this last step, to allow the others repo to sync.
        ```
