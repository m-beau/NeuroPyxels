Description: # Npyx: loading, processing and plotting Neuropixels data
        
        [![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/npyx.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/npyx/)
        
        Npyx is a pure python library built for electrophysiologists using Neuropixels. It features a suite of core utility functions for loading, processing and plotting Neuropixels data.
        
        This package results from the needs of an experimentalist who could not stand MATLAB, hence wrote himself a suite of functions to emotionally bear doing neuroscience. There isn't any dedicated preprint available yet, so if you enjoy this package and use it for your research, please cite [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-019-0381-8). Cheers!
        
        ## Documentation:
        Npyx works in harmony with the data formatting employed by [SpikeGLX](https://billkarsh.github.io/SpikeGLX/) used in combination with [Kilosort](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort) and [Phy](https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        Most npyx functions take at least one input: **`dp`**, which is the path to your Kilosort/phy dataset. You can find a [full description of the structure of such datasets](https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sorting_user_guide/#installation) on phy documentation.
        
        More precisely, every function requires the files `myrecording.ap.meta`, `spike_times.npy` and `spike_clusters.npy`. Then particular functions will require particular files: loading waveforms with `npyx.spk_wvf.wvf` or extracting your sync channel with `npyx.io.get_npix_sync` require the raw data `myrecording.ap.bin`, extracting the spike sorted group of your units `cluster_groups.tsv` and so on.
        
        Example use cases are:
        ### Load synchronization channel
        ```python
        from npyx.io import get_npix_sync
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        onsets, offsets = get_npix_sync(dp)
        # onsets/offsets are dictionnaries
        # whose keys are ids of sync channel where signal was detected,
        # and values the times of up (onsets) or down (offsets) threshold crosses in seconds.
        ```
        ### Get good units from dataset
        ```python
        from npyx.gl import get_units
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        units = get_units(dp, quality='good')
        ```
        ### Load spikes from unit u
        ```python
        from npyx.spk_t import trn
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        u=234
        t = trn(dp, u) # gets all spikes from unit 234, in samples
        ```
        
        ### Load waveforms from unit u
        ```python
        from npyx.io import read_spikeglx_meta
        from npyx.spk_t import ids, trn
        from npyx.spk_wvf import get_peak_chan, wvf, templates
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        u=234
        # returns a random sample of 100 waveforms from unit 234, in uV, across 384 channels
        waves = wvf(dp, u, n_waveforms=100, t_waveforms=82) # return array of shape (100, 82, 384) by default
        # Get the unit peak channel (channel with the biggest amplitude)
        peak_chan = get_peak_chan(dp,u)
        # extract the waveforms located on peak channel
        w=waves[:,:,peak_chan]
        
        # Extract waveforms of spikes occurring between
        # 900 and 1000s in the recording, because that's when your mouse scratched its butt
        fs=read_spikeglx_meta['sRateHz']
        t=trn(dp,u)/fs # convert in s
        ids=ids(dp,u)[(t>900)&(t<1000)]
        waves = wvf(dp, u, spike_ids=ids)
        
        # If you want to load the templates instead (lighter)
        temp = templates(dp,u) # return array of shape (n_templates, 82, n_channels)
        ```
        
        ### Compute auto/crosscorrelogram between 2 units
        ```python
        from npyx.corr import ccg
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        # returns ccg between 234 and 92 with a binsize of 0.2 and a window of 80
        c = ccg(dp, [234,92], cbin=0.2, cwin=80)
        ```
        
        ### Plot correlograms and waveforms from unit u
        ```python
        # all plotting functions return matplotlib figures
        from npyx.plot import plot_wvf
        dp = 'path/to/dataset'
        u=234
        # plot waveform, 2.8ms around center, on 8 channels around peak channel,
        # with no single waveforms in the background (sample_lines)
        fig = plot_wvf(dp, u, Nchannels=8, t_waveforms=2.8, sample_lines=0)
        
        # plot ccg between 234 and 92
        fig = plot_ccg(dp, [u,92], cbin=0.2, cwin=80)
        ```
        
        ### Merge datasets acquired on two probes simultaneously
        ```python
        # The three recordings need to include the same sync channel.
        from npyx.Prophyler import Prophyler
        dps = ['same_folder/lateralprobe_dataset',
               'same_folder/medialprobe_dataset',
               'same_folder/anteriorprobe_dataset']
        probenames = ['lateral','medial','anterior']
        dp_dict = {p:dp for p, dp in zip(dps, probenames)}
        multipro = Prophyler(dp_dic)
        dp=multipro.dp_pro
        # This will merge the 3 datasets (only relevant information, not the raw data) in a new folder at
        # same_folder/prophyler_lateralprobe_dataset_medialprobe_dataset_anteriorprobe_dataset
        # which can then be used as if it were a single dataset by all npyx functions.
        # The only difference is that units now need to be called as floats, of format unit_id.dataset_id.
        # lateralprobe, medial probe and anteriorprobe dataset_ids will be 0,1 and 2.
        t = trn(dp, 92.1) # get spikes of unit 92 in dataset 1 i.e. medialprobe
        fig=plot_ccg(dp,[10,0,92.1,cbin=0.2,cwin=80]) # compute CCG between 2 units across datasets
        ```
        
        There isn't any better doc atm - email [Maxime Beau](mailto:maximebeaujeanroch047@gmail.com) (PhD Hausser lab, UCL at time of writing) if you have any questions!

        ## Installation:
        
        Using a conda environment is very much advised. Instructions here: [manage conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
        
        Npyx supports Python 3.7+.
        
        - as a user
          - from pip (normally up to date)
          ```bash
          conda create -n my_env python=3.7
          conda activate my_env
          pip install npyx
          python -c 'import npyx' # should not return any error
          # If it does, install any missing dependencies with pip (hopefully none!)
          ```
          - from the remote repository (always up to date - still private at time of writing, pip is a prerelease)
          ```bash
          conda activate env_name
          pip install git+https://github.com/Npix-routines/NeuroPyxels@master
          ```
        - as a superuser (recommended if plans to work on it/regularly pull upgrades)
          > Tip: in an ipython/jupyter session, use `%load_ext autoreload` then `%autoreload` to make your local edits active in your session without having to restart your kernel. Amazing for development.
            ```bash
            conda activate my_env
            cd path/to/save_dir # any directory where your code will be accessible by your editor and safe. NOT downloads folder.
            git clone https://github.com/Npix-routines/NeuroPyxels
            cd NeuroPyxels
            python setup.py develop # this will create an egg link to save_dir, which means that you do not need to reinstall the package each time you pull an udpate from github.
            ```
            and pull every now and then:
            ```bash
            conda activate env_name
            cd path/to/save_dir/NeuroPyxels
            git pull
            # And that's it, thanks to the egg link no need to reinstall the package!
            ```
        <br/>

        ### Push local updates to github:
        ```bash
        # DO NOT DO THAT WITHOUT CHECKING WITH MAXIME FIRST
        # ONLY ON DEDICATED BRANCH CREATED WITH THE GITHUB BROWSER INTERFACE
        
        cd path/to/save_dir/NeuroPyxels
        git checkout DEDICATED_BRANCH_NAME # ++++++ IMPORTANT
        git add.
        git commit -m "commit details - try to be specific"
        git push origin DEDICATED_BRANCH_NAME # ++++++ IMPORTANT
        
        # Then pull request to master branch using the online github green button! Do not forget this last step, to allow the others repo to sync.
        ```
        
        ### Push local updates to PyPI (only Maxime)
        First change the version in ./setup.py in a text editor
        ```python
        setup(name='npyx',
              version='1.0',... # change to 1.1, 1.1.1...
        ```
        Then delete the old distribution files before re-generating them for the new version using twine:
        ```bash
        rm -r ./dist
        rm -r ./build
        rm -r ./npyx.egg-info
        python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel # this will generate version 1.1 wheel without overwriting version 1.0 wheel in ./dist
        ```
        Before pushing them to PyPI (older versions are saved online!)
        ```bash
        twine upload dist/*
